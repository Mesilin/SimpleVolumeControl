# SimpleVolumeControl
Hi, everybody
The project was conceived for teaching and practicing programming skills.
But unexpectedly, the resulting tool turned out to be very convenient. Try this!
The application allows you to adjust the volume in the system using the mouse wheel when the Caps Lock button is pressed. 
You no longer need to reach for the control on the speakers or look for the slider in the system tray. 
Just hold CapsLock and rotate the mouse wheel. In addition, pressing the wheel while the CapsLock is clamped pauses playback. 
Also in the settings, you can activate the mute option when you press ScrollLock.
Criticism, suggestions and suggestions for development are welcome!
